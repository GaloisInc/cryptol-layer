* Description
This layer adds support for the [[http://cryptol.net/][Cryptol]] language, including minimal syntax
highlighting and a REPL.

Note that [[https://github.com/thoughtpolice/cryptol-mode][cryptol-mode]] itself is fairly simple and a bit out of date, so this
layer can't provide much functionality.

* Install
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =cryptol= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file.

* Key bindings
